# Tapering Improvements to easyQuake Waveform Processing

## Summary
Added tapering to waveform windows in `detection_association_event` and related functions to avoid edge effects at the start and end of windowed data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Magnitude calculation windowing (Line ~1478)
**Function:** `select_3comp_remove_response`
```python
tr.trim(pick.time-30, pick.time+120)
# Apply tapering to avoid edge effects after windowing
tr.taper(max_percentage=0.05)
```

### 2. Response inclusion windowing (Line ~1555)  
**Function:** `select_3comp_include_response`
```python
tr.trim(pick.time-30, pick.time+120)
# Apply tapering to avoid edge effects after windowing
tr.taper(max_percentage=0.05)
```

### 3. Amplitude calculation windowing (Lines ~1631, 1634)
**Function:** `magnitude_quakeml` 
```python
# For longer window (80s)
tr1.trim(pick.time-20,pick.time+60)
# Apply tapering to avoid edge effects after windowing
tr1.taper(max_percentage=0.05)

# For shorter window (6s) 
st.trim(pick.time-1,pick.time+5)
# Apply tapering to avoid edge effects after windowing
st.taper(max_percentage=0.1)  # Higher percentage for shorter window
```

### 4. Data preparation windowing (Line ~3167)
```python
st_1.trim(UTCDateTime(pickP.split(' ')[-2])-60,UTCDateTime(pickP.split(' ')[-2])+60)
# Apply tapering to avoid edge effects after windowing
st_1.taper(max_percentage=0.05)
```

## Tapering Parameters Used

- **Standard windows (30-120s):** `max_percentage=0.05` (5% taper)
- **Short windows (6s):** `max_percentage=0.1` (10% taper)

The higher taper percentage for shorter windows ensures adequate edge smoothing relative to the window length.

## Technical Details

- **Purpose:** Prevents spectral artifacts and noise introduced by abrupt data truncation
- **Method:** Uses ObsPy's built-in `taper()` method with cosine tapering
- **Application:** Applied immediately after `trim()` operations but before any filtering or response removal
- **Compatibility:** Consistent with existing tapering in the codebase (see line 1369)

## Benefits

1. **Reduced edge effects:** Smooth transitions at window boundaries
2. **Improved signal processing:** Better spectral characteristics for filtering and response removal
3. **More accurate amplitudes:** Reduced contamination from windowing artifacts
4. **Consistent processing:** Harmonized with existing tapering practices in the codebase

## Files Modified

- `/Users/jwalter/easyQuake/easyQuake/easyQuake.py` - Added tapering to 4 waveform windowing locations

## Testing Recommendations

1. Compare amplitude measurements before/after tapering implementation
2. Verify that magnitude calculations remain stable
3. Check that pick association quality is maintained or improved
4. Monitor for any unexpected changes in event detection sensitivity
